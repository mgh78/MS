Introduction1
There is currently no cure for multiple sclerosis 
(MS). However, it can be treated. Many disease 
modifying therapies (DMTs) can reduce the 
number and severity of relapses as well as slow 
disease progression.
Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosisMS treatment aims to improve 
quality of life for people living 
with MS, for example by 
reducing symptoms and 
maintaining mobility.
For people living with MS, 
treating symptoms is a priority. 
Symptoms such as tight or stiff 
muscles, movement problems, 
pain or fatigue may be reduced 
through engaging in overall 
wellness practices or by  
making use of complementary 
therapies. Certain therapies 
might help people feel more  
in control of their MS or make 
them feel better overall, 
reducing stress and helping  
with relaxation. 
Definitions
In this guide, we define  
wellness practices as a variety 
of practices that anyone can  
do, regardless of MS, to help 
maintain physical and mental 
wellbeing, such as relaxation, 
healthy diet and exercise. Unlike 
most complementary therapies, 
wellness practices can often  
be done at home without the 
1  Introductionsupport of a practitioner. Each 
person with MS will have a 
different experience of which 
wellness practices work for 
them. Some wellness practices 
may need to be adapted to your 
personal needs.
We define complementary 
therapies as approaches that 
may be used alongside standard 
evidence-based treatments for 
MS. Complementary therapies 
are often paid for by individuals 
and performed by a practitioner 
in a professional setting, for 
example a clinic or studio. There 
is a wide range of therapies on 
offer. Several complementary 
therapies may provide relief for 
some MS symptoms, but others 
provide no benefit at all, and 
some can even cause harm. 
Purpose
This booklet gives an overview 
of wellness practices and 
complementary therapies that 
are sometimes used by people 
with MS in addition to DMTs. 
The authors reviewed available 
research to provide a summary 
of the evidence (or lack of

This booklet also includes 
information about some 
therapies that we explain why 
we don’t recommend people 
with MS use. 
While many wellness practices 
and complementary therapies 
are covered by this booklet, 
others exist. Some approaches 
are not available in every 
country. To learn more about 
what is available in your country, 
please contact your qualified 
healthcare provider or national 
MS organisation. Find MS 
organisations in your country here: https://www.msif.org/

The information in this booklet 
has been researched and 
reviewed in relation to adults 
(aged 18 and over) who have MS. 
There is very limited information 
available for the safety and 
effectiveness of any of these 
therapies for children and 
adolescents; therefore, the 
recommendations in this booklet 
are relevant for adults only.
Consulting your 
healthcare team2
This guide should not be used in the place  
of medical advice. MS is complex and 
presents differently in every person. MS 
treatment should be adjusted to each person.

93  Standard therapies for MS8Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosis
Standard  
therapies for MS3
There are three main  
approaches to treating MS: 
• treatments for a relapse
• disease modifying therapies (DMTs)
designed to prevent relapses
• therapies for symptoms not related  
to a relapse.If you’re thinking of trying 
complementary therapies 
or wellness practices 
alongside your MS DMT s, 
consult your qualified 
healthcare team first.
If you’re using health insurance, 
you might want to check whether 
an approach is covered by your 
insurance scheme before 
starting it.Managing your MS usually 
means working with a group of 
different healthcare specialists 
(a multidisciplinary team). Your 
qualified healthcare team is 
likely to include a neurologist, a 
general practitioner (GP), an MS 
nurse, rehabilitation specialists 
(for example, a physiotherapist 
or occupational therapist), 
mental health specialists  
(for example, a psychologist, 
mental health social worker, or 
psychiatrist) and a pharmacist.

Treatment for a relapse
MS relapses are caused by 
inflammation (swelling) in the 
central nervous system that 
damages the myelin coating 
surrounding nerve fibres. This 
damage slows or disrupts nerve 
signals, causing the symptoms 
of MS.
Acute relapses are commonly 
treated with steroids. These can 
be given in a vein (intravenously) 
or by mouth (orally) for a few 
days. Methylprednisolone is  
the steroid most often used; 
prednisone is another commonly 
used steroid.
Steroids work by damping down 
the inflammation that’s 
damaging the nerves. Steroids 
aren’t thought to have any long-
term benefit as an MS treatment 
but can be effective at:
• reducing inflammation
• shortening the duration of  
a relapse
• speeding up recovery from  
a relapse.The choice of DMTs will be 
guided by your MS disease 
activity (whether you are 
experiencing active relapses), 
the severity of your disease, and 
which treatments are available  
in your health care system. Read 
more about DMTs for MS here . 
Therapies for symptoms 
not related to a relapse
In addition to DMTs, therapies 
for symptoms are often 
prescribed to help manage 
chronic features of MS, such  
as fatigue, bladder control 
issues, spasticity (stiffness in 
the limbs), pain, speech and 
swallowing dysfunction. 
Although these therapies don’t 
affect the course of your MS, 
they can improve your quality  
of life. Treatments can include 
rehabilitation (such as 
physiotherapy, occupational 
therapy and speech therapy) 
and medications targeted at  
the specific symptom. Over  
30% of people with MS report 
depression; and treatment  
of mental health is a key aspect 
of MS care.If steroids don’t succeed in 
treating a relapse, a treatment 
called intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIG) can  
be used. IVIG can also be used  
in people who shouldn’t take 
steroids (such as women in  
the early stage of pregnancy). 
Plasmapheresis (plasma 
exchange) is another treatment 
that can be used when steroids 
fail to treat a relapse 
Plasmapheresis involves 
withdrawing blood, removing 
antibodies from the plasma 
thought to be active in MS, and 
replacing blood cells along with  
a new plasma fluid.
Disease modifying 
therapies (DMT s)
DMTs are not a cure for MS.  
They aim to prevent or reduce 
the number of relapses and slow 
down the overall progression of 
the disease. DMTs can be given 
in various ways including 
injectable medications, oral 
medications and intravenous 
infusions (a drip).

Section A: Wellness 
practices for people 
with MS4
Everyone should look after their overall 
wellness, no matter what health conditions 
you are living with. 
Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosisExercise, eating a healthy 
diet and mental health 
care are all important 
components of general 
wellness practices, as are 
limiting alcohol, not 
smoking and maintaining 
healthy sleep habits.
People with MS may decide to 
do a variety of wellness 
practices to help maintain their 
physical and mental wellbeing. 
Unlike many complementary 
therapies, wellness practices 
can often be done at home 
without the support of a 
practitioner. In this section we 
cover exercise, healthy diets and 
a range of relaxation techniques. 
You may need to adapt some 
wellness practices to your 
personal needs. Each person 
with MS will have a different 
experience of which wellness 
practices work for them. Seek 
advice from your qualified 
healthcare provider before 
starting a new wellness practice. 
Wellness practices should be 
used alongside standard 
12 134  Section A: Wellness practices for people with MStherapies for MS. No wellness 
practice or complementary 
therapy should be used instead 
of treatment with DMTs.
Exercise
Exercise can improve your 
quality of life and slow down 
the progression of MS. 
It’s a myth that exercise can 
trigger MS relapses. In fact,  
sport and exercise can improve 
wellness at every stage of MS. 
Strength training, cardiovascular 
training and mobility exercises 
can improve your quality of life 
and help you to do everyday 
tasks. Symptoms such as fatigue, 
balance disorders, muscle 
weakness, and tight or stiff 
muscles (spasticity) can be 
helped by regular training.1, 2, 3 
Training two to three times a 
week is often sufficient.4
Exercise gets your circulation 
going and improves the oxygen 
supply around the body. This  
is important for the function  
and maintenance of nerve  
cells. Exercise can also 
encourage the body to reduce 

14
Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosis 15
inflammation and so supports 
the immune system.5
Exercise can strengthen 
connections between nerve 
cells,6 helping them to 
coordinate muscle movements. 
Every movement we make 
requires a complex interaction 
between nerve cells and 
muscles. Strengthening these 
connections can help to 
counteract nerve damage. 
It’s important to adapt the type 
and intensity of exercise to your 
MS and fitness level. If you have 
higher levels of disability, are 
afraid of injury, or your MS 
symptoms are worsened by  
heat (known as the Uhthoff 
phenomenon), we recommend 
you consult your physician and 
physiotherapist. In any case, 
avoid exhaustion. Sometimes, 
people try harder than they 
should to prove to themselves or 
others what they can do. It is 
important to listen to your body. 
In this section we summaries 
various forms of exercise.  
For further information, contact 
a healthcare professional or  
MS organisation.  Cardiovascular training 
Cardiovascular training  
(for example brisk walking, 
jogging, Nordic walking, using  
a stationary exercise bike or 
pedal bike, swimming, dance  
and Zumba) helps to maintain 
and develop motor skills (the 
coordination of movement).  
It gets the circulation going  
and helps to maintain mobility 
and improve coordination.7, 8, 9  
In cardiovascular training,  
you sustain light-to-moderate 
exertion for around  
20–30 minutes.
One type of cardiovascular 
training is high-intensity interval 
training (HIIT). During HIIT, you 
alternate short, very strenuous 
phases of exercise with rest 
phases. HIIT is particularly 
effective in training the 
cardiovascular system and 
coordination of muscles. 
Studies in people affected by 
MS have shown very good 
effects of HIIT, including for 
people with limited mobility.10, 11 
Exercise training can be 
performed using only the upper 
limbs for persons with limited leg 
function or impaired balance.
Balance training 
Many people with MS have 
coordination difficulties and 
balance disorders. Motor 
coordination (the coordination 
of movement) can be practised 
and improved through balance 
training.12 In this training, you 
can use swing sticks, vibration 
platforms and other training 
equipment to challenge your 
balance. Balance training is 
particularly useful when 
combined with other sport  
and exercise. Strength training 
Strength training (for example, 
weightlifting and resistance 
training) aims to strengthen  
the muscles, joints and bones. In 
contrast to cardiovascular 
training, higher loads are moved 
over shorter periods of time. It’s 
no longer believed that strength 
training is harmful to people 
with MS. On the contrary, 
strength training helps with 
everyday tasks (for example, 
lifting objects and climbing 
stairs), improves stability and 
bone strength, and protects 
against muscle loss.13, 14 A Danish

Yo ga
Yoga is a holistic, traditional, 
functional life philosophy that 
began in India. It combines 
movement and spirituality. 
Nowadays, different types of yoga 
are practiced all over the world. 
Depending on the type of yoga,  
it may focus on meditation (for 
example, Jnana Yoga) or physical 
training (for example, Hatha Yoga). 
Yoga is particularly suitable for 
maintaining mobility and 
coordination.18,19,20 There is some 
evidence of positive benefits for 
people with MS, and it is unlikely 
to be harmful. Most people can 
perform yoga readily. However, 
certain yoga postures are 
potentially harmful to joints.  
There is a particular risk of injury  
if you force yourself into positions 
or stretches beyond your 
capability. So, be mindful of your 
physical limits and, if in doubt, 
seek advice from medically 
trained specialists. In addition,  
if you are sensitive or intolerant  
to heat, you should avoid Bikram 
yoga (hot yoga), as it could worsen 
MS symptoms. Healthy diet
A healthy diet is important 
for general health. 
Moreover, gut health can 
directly affect our metabolism, 
hormone production and 
immune system.21, 22 The 
connections between digestion 
and chronic diseases are not fully 
understood.23 However, it’s 
suspected that diet can influence 
MS symptoms.24, 25 
Eating a healthy diet means 
having freshly prepared, varied 
meals with lots of fibre, fruit and 
vegetables. Unsaturated fatty 
acids and natural sources of 
vitamin D and vitamin B12 are 
important, as well as calcium 
(found in eggs, dairy and meat, 
for example). Having enough 
fluid (about 2 litres of water 
daily) is important too. You 
should avoid alcohol, processed 
sugar and processed food 
products, or consume only  
a small amount.26study showed that strength 
training in MS helps to protect 
nerve cells and total brain size.15
Strength training is a 
complementary therapy that’s 
generally recommended for 
people with MS as long as the 
right technique and professional 
support are used to prevent 
injuries. Particularly good 
results have been achieved 
when people combine HIIT  
and strength training.16
Pilates
Pilates is a form of exercise  
that aims to build strength and 
flexibility. You can perform the 
exercises at a level of intensity 
that is appropriate for your 
ability. There is some evidence 
that Pilates-based programmes 
can improve balance for people 
with MS.17 Pilates may also have 
benefits for improving overall 
physical functioning and 
reducing how fatigued you feel. 
It is unlikely to be harmful.

18
Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosis 19Because MS can reduce 
physical activity, some people 
with MS are more prone to 
weight gain.27 Obesity may be  
an added health burden, making 
movement more difficult and 
speeding up the loss of mobility. 
In addition, excess body fat may 
send pro-inflammatory signals 
that influence MS symptoms.28 
Excess body fat is also linked to 
other diseases such as type 2 
diabetes, dyslipidaemia (an 
imbalance of lipids in the blood), 
and high blood pressure.
Some forms of dieting aid 
weight loss and improve general 
health. However, be aware that 
radical diets can weaken the 
body and be an extra burden. 
Diet pills that bind nutrients or 
have a laxative effect are 
dangerous. They can affect the 
absorption of medicines and 
important nutrients. 
Some people need to follow 
specific dietary recommendations, 
for example if they take certain 
medications, have food allergies, 
or have certain food 
intolerances (for example, a 
4  Section A: Wellness practices for people with MS
gluten intolerance). If you follow 
a specific diet (for example, 
vegan, vegetarian, keto or gluten 
free), let your doctor know. This 
is because it can affect your 
blood and laboratory test 
results.25, 29 Specific types of diet 
are explored in more detail in 
Section B.
A nutritionist or dietician can 
give you professional advice to 
help you to plan your diet 
optimally and integrate it into 
your everyday life. They’ll teach 
you about how nutrition, 
digestion and symptoms are 
interlinked and give you tips on 
adjustments to make to your 
diet.30 Check the background 
and qualifications of any 
nutritionist, dietician or other 
professional you want to use 
before seeking their nutritional 
advice. Your healthcare team or 
national MS organisation can 
help you with this. 
More information about  
diet and nutrition for MS  
can be found here .Relaxation 
techniques
Switching off mentally 
— everyone can benefit 
from that!
People with MS deal with the 
stresses of a chronic (long-term) 
illness daily. Relaxation is not 
found only on vacation — it can 
also be practiced and integrated 
into everyday life.
Relaxation in itself is not therapy, 
but with relaxation techniques 
you can positively influence the 
course of your MS and its 
symptoms.31, 32 Relaxation is not 
only mental — it’s also physical. 
When we relax, our breathing 
slows, muscle tone decreases, 
and stress hormones are reduced.
This can relieve tension and has 
been proven to help chronic 
pain.33 Relaxation also has a 
positive effect on the 
cardiovascular, immune, nervous 
and digestive systems.
The effectiveness of relaxation 
has been proven, but how well 
each relaxation technique works Hands handling food, Morocco

20Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosis21varies from person to person. 
You’ll need to work out what’s 
most beneficial for you. 
If you have severe physical 
limitations, gentle methods  
of relaxation are most suitable. 
However, if you’re active you may 
prefer techniques that involve 
movement. You might like to 
combine different relaxation 
techniques. Find something you 
can easily integrate into your 
everyday life because the more 
often you can relax, the better!
Many of the relaxation methods 
listed here use mindfulness and 
bodily awareness. For most 
people, these promote more 
positive self-perception and 
strengthen inner balance. 
However, some people find that 
negative thoughts worsen while 
doing some relaxation 
techniques, especially 
meditation. This can increase 
anxiety and discomfort.34 If you 
have insecurities, anxiety or 
clinical depression, get a trained 
psychologist to help you discover 
the best relaxation techniques  
for you. Relaxation techniques require 
you to consciously draw your 
attention inwards and observe 
your own thoughts. They’re 
unsuitable for patients with 
psychoses and severe cognitive 
impairments, such as advanced 
dementia.34 
Advanced physical MS symptoms 
can limit relaxation techniques  
in some people. For example, 
breathlessness or heart problems 
can stop you performing some 
breathing-based relaxation 
techniques because these could 
leave you more out of breath.35  
If in doubt, consult your 
healthcare team. 
In some countries, costs for 
relaxation-based therapy may be 
covered by health insurance. 
However, the services covered 
vary depending on reason for use 
and service provider. It’s best to 
ask your health insurance 
company in advance.
Some well-known relaxation 
techniques are explained in the 
following section. Please keep  
in mind that scientific studies have typically only looked at the 
positive (not negative) effects  
of relaxation. In addition, there  
is no evidence that any of these 
methods have any effect on the 
disease course of MS.36 Therefore, 
relaxation techniques should  
only be used alongside regular 
MS treatments. Imagination 
Imagination can help you to 
develop a positive self-image 
through the power of your own 
thoughts. There are different 
approaches to imagination  
such as guided fantasy trips  
to beautiful places or creating 
images in your mind.32, 36 There  
is limited evidence for positive 
benefits on the course of MS, 
but this approach is unlikely to 
be harmful.

Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosis 23fine motor skills (movements  
to perform a task) are also 
trained.43,44,45 
Music and art therapies can be 
used alongside medical therapies 
for MS. There are lots of different 
ways to explore music and art 
therapy, and MS organisations 
often provide them. 
Qi gong and T ai Chi
Qi gong is a traditional  
Chinese method for training 
your body and mind. According 
to traditional teaching, Qi, the  
life energy, is harmonised  
and strengthened in the body 
through Qi gong. It includes 
mindfulness exercises, 
breathing exercises, gentle movement and meditation. As 
Qi gong is mainly done standing 
up, it also trains balance.46,47 
There is limited evidence for 
positive benefits for people with 
MS, but this approach is unlikely 
to be harmful. 
The Chinese tradition of T ai Chi  
is based on a self-defence 
technique and also led to a 
Buddhist-inspired movement 
theory called T ai Chi Chuan. 
Similar to Qi gong, T ai Chi is based 
on the combination of meditation 
and slow, mindful movement. Due 
to the influences from martial 
arts, flexibility, stability and 
balance are more important in  
T ai Chi than in Qi gong.48 There  
is limited evidence for positive 
benefits for people with MS,  
but this approach is unlikely  
to be harmful.Mindfulness-based 
stress reduction
Mindfulness-based stress 
reduction is a relaxation 
technique that can be used as 
part of a person’s clinical care. It 
combines mindfulness exercises, 
meditation techniques and slow 
movements. Studies show that 
mindfulness-based stress 
reduction can have a positive 
effect for the general 
population.37, 28, 29, 40 However, 
these programs are not safe for 
people with certain psychological 
or mental health conditions. Ask 
your practitioner whether 
mindfulness-based stress 
reduction is suitable for you.Meditation
Meditation is a mental exercise 
to consciously direct your 
attention. Many cultures use 
meditation for relaxation or 
prayer. Meditation exercises 
often use a combination of 
breathing exercises, specific 
postures, speech formulas 
(mantras), prayers and singing. 
Similarly, a meditative state 
(where you’re fully absorbed in 
the current moment) can be 
achieved in many ways. 
Meditation can be guided, or 
you can do it on your own.32 
There is limited evidence for 
positive benefits for people with 
MS, but this approach is unlikely 
to be harmful.
Music and art therapy
Creative activities can help 
people to relax and have a  
proven positive effect on mental 
wellbeing.41 Music and art 
therapies can help people with 
MS to switch off and live better 
with MS symptoms.42 When 
painting, designing, dancing or 
making music, movement and

Section B: Therapies that 
may have some benefit 
for people with MS5
There are many types of therapy that are 
sometimes used by people with MS as a 
complement to their clinical care. 
Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosis 24 25 5  Section B: Therapies that may have some benefit for people with MSIf you’re considering trying any 
complementary therapies, they 
should only be used alongside 
standard therapies for MS.  
No wellness practice or 
complementary therapy  
should be used instead of 
treatment with DMTs.
Acupuncture and 
acupressure
Acupuncture is based on 
traditional Chinese medicine.  
It’s based on the theory that, in  
a healthy person, the Qi (life 
energy) flows unhindered through 
meridians (energy channels in the 
body), while in people with an 
illness or ailment the Qi doesn’t 
flow properly due to disturbances 
and blockages of energy.49
Acupuncture often involves a 
practitioner inserting needles into 
the skin along the meridians. This 
comes with a risk of infection and 
other side effects.50 However, 
some types of acupuncture don’t 
use needles, such as acupressure 
(which uses pressure from 
fingers) or red-light acupuncture.In this section, we have 
described several of them 
but do not provide an 
exhaustive list. Some 
complementary therapies 
may provide relief for 
certain MS symptoms 
experienced by some 
people, but others provide 
no benefit at all. 
People often need to pay  
for complementary therapies 
privately. A practitioner often 
performs them in a professional 
setting, for example a clinic  
or studio. 
There is a lack of evidence for 
many complementary therapies, 
especially in relation to MS, 
because very little research  
has been conducted. Many 
studies only include a few people 
or are not conclusive. Unlike 
DMTs, the therapies in this 
section are not proven to reduce 
relapses or to limit disability in 
MS. If you are interested in using 
complementary therapies, please 
ask your healthcare team whether 
they are safe for you to use. 

26
Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosis 27Aromatherapy
Fragrant oils and incense have 
been used since ancient times. 
In aromatherapy, scents and 
plant extracts are combined  
in essential oils. These oils can 
be used in aroma lamps, baths, 
inhalation, compresses or 
massages. Some people find 
them soothing and relaxing.58, 59 
People with MS sometimes  
use aromatherapy with an aim 
to improve their sleep, mood  
or pain.58, 60
As long as you don’t have any 
allergies and stick to the 
instructions, aromatherapy is 
usually harmless. It’s important 
that you only use essential oils 
diluted as instructed and never 
eat or drink them. In high 
concentrations, essential oils 
are highly toxic and can cause 
organ damage.61 This also 
applies to household products 
such as eucalyptus (cineol) and 
peppermint oil (menthol), 
orange/lemon peel, camphor, 
turpentine oil, tea tree oil and 
clove oil.Ayurveda
Ayurveda comes from Indian 
tradition and is based on 
philosophy, nutrition and 
traditional Indian medicine.62 
According to Ayurveda, illness is 
caused by an imbalance between 
mind, body and spirituality. 
Nowadays, individual parts of 
Ayurvedic are often used, such  
as Ayurvedic nutrition, yoga, 
meditation or massage (see also 
the chapter “Other methods”). 
There is no scientific evidence for 
positive effects of Ayurveda for 
people with MS. Many Ayurvedic 
treatments are harmless as a 
complementary therapy.63, 64 
However, Ayurvedic herbal 
medicines of unclear origin may 
be contaminated and so you 
must take care if purchasing 
them. Before taking medicinal 
plants/teas and changing your 
diet, always seek advice from  
your healthcare team.To help you choose an 
acupuncture practitioner, get 
sufficient information on their 
training and qualifications. In 
some countries, you may find  
a registry of accredited 
acupuncture practitioners. 
Scientists disagree about 
whether acupuncture works. 
There have been no large-scale 
controlled clinical trials to 
evaluate the safety and 
effectiveness of acupuncture in 
people with MS. However, some 
positive effects have been 
observed in people with MS  
who have chronic (long-term) 
pain.37,51,52,53 Therefore, 
acupuncture may be used as a 
complementary therapy for MS  
as long as it is expertly performed 
by a trained professional. Check  
with your healthcare team  
before starting acupuncture. Animal-assisted therapy
Animal-assisted therapies can 
be used as a complementary 
therapy for both physical and 
mental illnesses. Therapy 
animals include dogs, cats, 
horses, llamas and dolphins. 
People with MS can benefit from 
interactions with animals, as well 
as from exercise.54 Working with 
trained horses (hippotherapy)  
can have particularly good  
results because riding can  
have a positive effect on MS 
symptoms.55, 56, 57 
To support animal welfare, get 
sufficient information about the 
care of the animals before 
choosing an animal therapy 
provider. We recommend that  
you try to select providers who 
are recognised by a relevant 
professional association.

Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosis 29drowsiness, diarrhoea and loss of 
appetite. Long-term side effects 
of CBD are unknown. Other 
cannabis products may come 
from an unknown origin, with no 
way of knowing the types and 
concentration of the cannabinoid 
components, or how pure the 
products are. 
Sativex® is a mouth spray made 
from equal amounts of THC and 
CBD. It is the only cannabinoid-
based drug that is licensed in 
some countries to treat 
moderate-to-severe muscle 
spasticity for people with MS who 
have not responded adequately 
to other anti-spasticity 
treatments. Research shows it 
has a modest benefit on these 
symptoms for some people.71,72,73 
In some countries, other 
cannabis-based medicinal 
products that are licensed to 
treat other conditions (such  
as nabilone, used for cancer 
patients) may sometimes be 
prescribed ‘off-label’ to help 
relieve pain for people with MS.
As some of the side effects of 
cannabis-based medications Biofeedback 
The biofeedback method uses 
physical measures such as your 
pulse, breathing, heart rhythm 
and muscle tension. By 
monitoring physical reactions, the 
effects of relaxation methods or 
physiotherapy can be measured. 
Biofeedback is believed to train 
the connection between your 
perception, muscle activity and 
other body signals. This is said  
to have a positive effect on 
symptoms such as depression, 
sleep disorders, muscle tension 
and urinary incontinence.65 
However, scientists disagree on 
whether biofeedback works.32, 66  
It has no side effects and can  
be used alongside conventional 
therapy. It’s usually only available 
through a private service but is 
sometimes provided as part of 
rehabilitation or at a stay-in clinic.
Cannabis therapy 
There are different varieties of 
cannabis plant, and many 
different products can be derived 
from cannabis. Cannabis 
contains molecules called cannabinoids, and the main ones 
studied are tetrahydrocannabinol 
(THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). 
THC is a psychoactive substance 
that changes the way the brain 
functions; it can alter perception, 
mood or behaviour. CBD is not 
psychoactive. Cannabis products 
may have either or both of these 
compounds in different 
concentrations and proportions.
Recreational cannabis (for 
example, marijuana or hash) is 
illegal in many countries, with 
some forms having very high 
levels of THC. The potential side 
effects of cannabis use are 
anxiety disorders, depression, 
gastrointestinal problems, fatigue 
and dizziness. Smoking cannabis 
increases the risk of cancer and 
stroke. There is also a risk of 
developing psychological and 
physical symptoms of 
dependency.67,68,69,70 
CBD oil can be obtained in some 
countries as a food supplement. 
There is no evidence that 
products containing CBD have 
any benefit for MS. Short-term 
side effects of CBD include

and thinking, it is possible  
that medicinal cannabis could 
exacerbate cognitive problems 
for people with MS. Therefore,  
any decision to use medicinal 
cannabis should be made with 
advice from your qualified 
healthcare providers. 
In some countries, cannabis is 
legal to use; some countries  
allow cannabis consumption 
under medical supervision;  
in other countries all forms  
of cannabis use (including 
medicinal) are illegal. If you are 
considering using any medicinal 
product based on cannabis, it is 
important to know what is legal  
in your country, state or territory. 
Contact your local MS 
organisation for more advice.
Chiropractic therapy  
Chiropractic medicine is based 
on the idea that poor alignment 
of the bones in the spine can 
cause abnormal pressure on  
the spinal nerves and lead to 
various health conditions. Spinal 
manipulation methods (known as ‘adjustments’) are believed to 
normalise bone position and 
relieve pressure on the nerves. 
Research of the benefit of 
chiropractic for people with MS 
is limited and some studies are 
poor quality, but chiropractic 
has been shown to relieve pain 
in people with back problems.74 
Therefore, many health 
insurance companies pay  
for chiropractic if it’s done  
by a doctor with the  
appropriate training. 
When done by a trained doctor, 
side effects are rare. However, 
incorrect manipulation of the 
spine can cause severe damage 
to the discs between your 
vertebrae, bones and vessels, 
with a risk of spine trauma  
and stroke.74
Cold therapy
Cold therapy, also known as 
cryotherapy, is based on the 
finding that some people with 
MS find cold beneficial. The cold 
can be applied in a range of 
ways, including cold showers 
and baths, cooling pads, cold clothing and cold chambers. 
A cold stimulus can temporarily 
relieve pain and so is a suitable 
complementary therapy to  
treat pain.75 However, no  
long-term improvements in  
pain have been seen. 
You should only have cold 
therapy for a short time and 
under supervision (for example, 
in a physiotherapy practice) in 
order to prevent tissue damage.
Craniosacral therapy
Craniosacral therapy is a  
hands-on procedure where the 
so-called ‘craniosacral rhythm’ is 
harmonised with gentle touch. 
This is meant to improve the 
body’s energy flows. 
There is no scientific proof that 
craniosacral rhythm exists. 
However, the procedure is safe 
as a complementary treatment 
if carried out by a trained 
professional and shows pain-
relieving effects in some people 
experiencing chronic pain.76, 77Dietary supplements
We recommend only taking 
dietary supplements after 
getting expert advice. T aking  
too much can lead to health 
issues. Also, some supplements 
can interact with medicines, 
stopping them working as  
well or causing side effects. 
Therefore, you should always 
discuss dietary supplements 
with your healthcare team 
before starting them.
People with MS often take 
vitamin D supplements.  
Low vitamin D levels have  
been linked to poorer cognitive 
function in people with MS, and 
there is some evidence that 
vitamin D supplements could

Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosis 33Hypnotherapy
In hypnotherapy, the person 
being treated is put into a 
trance-like state using  
hypnosis. In some countries, 
hypnotherapy is recognised  
as a method of psychotherapy. 
Hypnosis can reduce pain and 
anxiety, but it can also increase 
them.85, 86 Its effectiveness in MS 
varies from person to person. 
Hypnotherapy should only be 
done by a professional trained in 
psychology, such as a psychiatrist.Magnetic field therapy 
or magnetic field 
resonance therapy
In magnetic field therapy,  
also known as magnetic field 
resonance therapy, magnets are 
put on the body. The magnets 
come in a range of forms: from 
magnetic shoe inserts, magnetic 
jewellery and magnetic mats to 
devices that make pulsating 
magnetic fields. 
People providing magnet 
therapy say the function of the 
body’s cells is stimulated by the 
magnetic field. However, the 
effectiveness of magnetic  
field therapy in treating health 
conditions is not proven.87, 88 
Magnetic therapy is dangerous 
for pregnant women and people 
with a pacemaker or other  
metal implant. 
Manual therapy
In manual therapy, a 
physiotherapist uses  
special hand movements  
and mobilisation techniques. 
Mobilisation can be passive 
(meaning a practitioner moves 
5  Section B: Therapies that may have some benefit for people with MSimprove cognition.78, 79 Vitamin D 
is also important for bone health 
and reducing the risk of 
fractures. Currently, there is no 
evidence that vitamin D impacts 
the course of MS.80 T aking too 
much vitamin D is dangerous.  
It can cause gradual poisoning, 
increasing calcium in the blood 
(hypercalcaemia) which can lead 
to severe side effects and organ 
damage. Therefore, check how 
much vitamin D you should take 
with your healthcare team. 
Omega-3 fatty acids, for example 
from fish oil capsules, have an 
anti-inflammatory effect and 
show positive effects in people 
with MS.81 In the event of taking 
too much, however, cholesterol 
levels can rise, the tendency to 
bleed increases, and the 
immune system can weaken. 
Check with your healthcare 
team about omega-3 fatty acids.
You should also consult your 
healthcare team if you are 
thinking of taking any type of 
herbal food supplement (see 
section on Herbal medicine).Homeopathy
According to homeopathic 
teaching, a “potentised” 
(meaning diluted and shaken) 
dose of a poison can heal 
exactly the symptoms that a 
high dose would cause. This  
is the ‘principle of similarity’. 
Homeopathic remedies are 
based on extremely diluted 
substances — so much so that 
there is typically nothing left  
of the poison. According to the 
theory, repeated dilution with 
water, ethanol or glycerin 
releases the spiritual power  
of the respective substance. 
Scientific studies have not found 
any effectiveness.82,83,84 
Homeopathy should only be 
considered as an addition (not 
alternative) to DMTs. Serious 
side effects of ingredients given 
at homeopathic doses are usually 
rare, even if the substance would 
be partly toxic at higher doses.

34
Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosis 35your body) or active (meaning 
you move your body yourself).  
In some cases, special devices 
are also used for traction 
(pulling), such as sling tables  
or spinal stretchers.
Mobilisation can sometimes 
reduce acute (sudden and severe) 
symptoms. However, combining 
mobilisation with exercises to 
strengthen the musculoskeletal 
system is usually required to 
reduce symptoms long term.89
Only specially trained 
physiotherapists should carry  
out manual therapy. It can be 
prescribed by a doctor. There  
is limited evidence of positive 
effects of manual therapy in MS,90 
but it is unlikely to be harmful. Massage
Massage therapy can relax 
muscles, helping to 
reduces stress made 
worse by muscle tension. 
While massage can help relieve 
stress and promote relaxation, 
there is no evidence that it has 
any effect on the course of MS. 
There is some evidence that  
it can help with MS symptoms. 
Different types of massage  
are described in the  
following section.
Classic massage/
Swedish massage
In classic massage (also known 
as a Swedish massage or medical 
massage), a therapist uses hand 
movements to stretch, pull and 
apply pressure to the skin and 
muscles. This reduces tension, 
hardening and stress and also 
improves blood circulation. 
There is limited evidence that 
classic massages may have a 
positive effect on the nerves, 
helping to treat muscle weakness, 
muscle stiffness and tightness (spasticity), sharp pain from 
nerves (neuralgia) and sensory 
disorders.91 Classic massage is 
unlikely to be harmful. 
Lymphatic massage 
Lymphatic drainage is a special 
type of massage. Lymphatic 
massage is used to treat the 
accumulation of lymph fluid  
in the body, known as 
lymphoedema. For this purpose, 
pressure, suction or both are 
applied to the body using 
specific grips. This increases 
blood flow, activates the lymph 
vessels and supports the 
circulation of lymph fluid.92 
Lymphatic massage is often 
used in people with MS as part 
of physiotherapy. In some 
countries, it’s covered by health 
insurance. Lymphatic massage 
can reduce local swelling and 
therefore pain.93 However, it’s 
not been proven to alter the 
disease course of MS.94, 95, 96
Shiatsu
Shiatsu is a system of massage 
originating from Japan that 
focuses on the prevention of poor health. It uses pressure 
from fingers with the aim of 
improving blood circulation 
through the body. There is very 
limited research on the effect  
of Shiatsu for people with MS, 
but it is unlikely to be harmful. 
Underwater massage 
and underwater  
pressure massage 
Underwater massage is 
conventional massage used for 
muscle relaxation that takes 
place in a warm water bath.  
The warmth and buoyancy of  
the water can increase the 
relaxing effect of the massage. 
The scientific evidence for 
underwater massage is the same 
as for conventional massage.
Underwater pressure massage 
is similar but is done with water 
jets rather than a therapist. 
This exerts more pressure on 
the tissue and is individually 
adjusted by the size of the 
nozzle and the amount of water.
5  Section B: Therapies that may have some benefit for people with MS
Gao Wen, person with MS, China

36
Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosis 37Some people with MS find  
hot baths uncomfortable. If  
this happens to you, mention  
it to your practitioner – the 
temperature should always  
be set to your comfort level.
Wellness massage 
Wellness massages are used 
primarily for relaxation. Types 
include reflex zone massage, 
hot stone massage and meridian 
(energy channel) massage. 
There is no evidence for positive 
effects in people with MS, but 
they are unlikely to cause harm. 
Other massage 
techniques: Bowen 
therapy and myotherapy
Bowen therapy involves gently 
stretching soft tissue in your 
body, focusing on muscle, 
tendons and ligaments, with the 
aim of stimulating the nervous 
system, promoting relaxation 
and reducing pain. Myotherapy  
is a form of massage therapy  
that focuses on areas with tight 
muscle fibres. It aims to reduce 
tension and pain in the muscle. 
There is no evidence for positive effects of either of these 
therapies in people with MS, but 
they are unlikely to cause harm. 
Neural therapy
Neural therapy is claimed to 
eliminate or temporarily switch 
off so-called ‘interference fields’ in 
the body using injections of small 
amounts of local anaesthetic. 
Examples of anaesthetics used 
are procaine, lidocaine, 
mepivacaine and prilocaine. 
The practice is based on the 
belief that any body part has  
the potential to become an 
‘interference field’ and thus 
cause chronic diseases. In most 
cases, these are areas of long-
term inflammation, such as the 
tonsils, sinuses, the tooth and 
jaw region, the thyroid gland or 
scar tissue.97
There is no scientific proof that 
‘interference fields’ exist or that 
neural therapy is effective in 
MS.98, 99 If used incorrectly, local 
anaesthetics can cause abnormal 
heart rhythm and damage the 
central nervous system. Orthomolecular  
medicine  
Orthomolecular medicine is 
based on micronutrients 
(vitamins, minerals and trace 
elements) but goes beyond 
nutritional supplements.  
It’s based on the belief that 
diseases arise from biochemical 
imbalances in the body and can 
be cured by correcting the 
imbalance. In orthomolecular 
medicine, high doses of 
micronutrients are given.  
The effect of orthomolecular 
medicine for people with MS has 
not been reliably studied and it  
is not considered to be an 
evidence-based therapy.
Osteopathy
Osteopathy is a hands-on 
therapy. Osteopathy tends to  
use gentle touch and pressure 
massage and ‘adjusts’ all parts  
of the body. Depending on the 
school and training, there can  
be overlap between use of 
osteopathy and chiropractic. 
Osteopathy is often claimed to 
have pain-relieving effects.100, 101 Osteopathic manipulation is 
generally well tolerated. There’s  
a low risk of spinal trauma with 
low back manipulation and 
stroke with neck manipulation.
Reflexology
Reflexology has its roots in 
traditional Chinese medicine.  
It involves pressure applied to 
specific points on the feet that 
are believed to correspond to 
different areas of the body, 
promoting healing. There is 
limited research on the effects  
of reflexology for people with MS. 
Some small studies have shown 
benefits for muscle stiffness, 
bladder and sensory symptoms 
and fatigue. Reflexology is a 
low-risk therapy but should be 
used with caution in those with 
foot conditions, such as gout, 
ulcers, vascular disease or 
arthritis.101, 102
5  Section B: Therapies that may have some benefit for people with MS

38
Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosis 39Reiki
Reiki practitioners believe  
that healing currents of energy 
surround us and these can be 
directed into the body through 
touch. In this way, reiki masters 
aim to heal energy blockages and 
disturbances. Reiki sessions are 
gentle and have no side effects. 
However, there is no scientific 
proof that they work.103
Respiratory therapy
Respiratory therapy helps  
you to think about and control  
your breathing. There are many 
different techniques that can 
strengthen the respiratory 
muscles and help reduce  
stress.99 
However, if you perform 
respiratory therapy incorrectly  
it can lead to hyperventilation 
(breathing too fast or deeply)  
or respiratory problems. When 
used in people with MS-related 
breathing problems or lung 
conditions (for example 
COVID-19), serious complications 
can occur.104 For this reason, you 
should always have a professional with you when you 
practice respiratory therapy.
Singing bowl therapy
Singing bowls are bowl-shaped 
ritual objects from Tibetan 
Buddhism. In singing bowl 
therapy, they’re placed on or 
above the body and struck with  
a mallet. The resulting vibrations 
and tones are intended to 
harmonise and heal the energies 
of the body. There is no proof 
that singing bowl therapy works, 
but there are no known side 
effects either.105, 106
5  Section B: Therapies that may have some benefit for people with MSSpecific types  
of diet
Eating a healthy diet is 
important for general 
health and wellness  
(see Section A). 
There is no diet that can change 
the course of MS, however 
specific foods or types of diet are 
the subject of many research 
studies. Evidence is limited on 
the effectiveness of specific 
diets, and most have not been 
studied in a rigorous, controlled 
way. Strict diets can be hard to 
follow, and it is important to 
make sure you’re not missing out 
on the healthy nutrition you 
need. Speak to your doctor or 
nutritionist/dietitian before 
making any major changes to 
your diet, particularly if you have 
any other health conditions as 
well as MS.Modified  
Mediterranean diet
This diet is rich in olive oil, fish, 
nuts, fruits and vegetables. 
People on this diet do not eat 
any meat or dairy and limit most 
processed foods and salt. There 
is some limited evidence that 
people with MS undertaking a 
modified Mediterranean diet may 
experience weight loss, reduced 
fatigue, reduced disability and 
improved quality of life.107
Ketogenic diet
A ketogenic diet (or modified 
Atkins diet) involves consuming 
low amounts of carbohydrate – 
the exact amount recommended 
varies but could be less than  
50g per day. People on this diet 
get more of their energy from 
fats and protein instead. There  
is some limited evidence that 
people with MS following a 
ketogenic diet may experience 
weight loss, reduced fatigue, 
depression and/or disability, and 
improved quality of life.108,109 
However, the effectiveness and 
safety of a long-term ketogenic 
diet is not yet known. Singing bowl therapy


40
Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosis 41Modified palaeolithic 
diet (Wahls diet)
A palaeolithic diet includes 
fruits, vegetables, nuts, fish  
and meat but avoids dairy,  
eggs, gluten and processed 
foods. The Wahls diet is based 
on a palaeolithic diet and is part 
of a wider protocol that includes 
vitamins, meditation and 
exercise. There is some limited 
evidence that following the 
Wahls diet along with exercising 
may reduce fatigue for people 
with MS.110
McDougall diet
The McDougall diet is plant 
based, vegan and very low fat. 
People on this diet avoid eating 
meat, dairy, eggs and oils. There 
is some limited evidence that 
this type of diet may lead to 
weight loss and reduced fatigue 
for people with MS.111
Swank diet
The Swank diet is low in fat, with 
people consuming less than 40 
grams per day of unsaturated fats 
and less than 15 grams per day  
of saturated fats. There is some limited evidence that this type  
of diet may be associated with a 
decreased risk of disability over 
time for people with MS.112
Intermittent fasting / 
caloric restriction
Caloric restriction involves 
reducing the number of calories 
you consume every day. 
Intermittent fasting involves a 
substantial reduction in calorie 
intake on some days of the week. 
There is some limited evidence 
that this type of diet may be 
associated with weight loss and 
improved emotional wellbeing 
for people with MS.113
5  Section B: Therapies that may have some benefit for people with MS
Transcutaneous 
electrical nerve 
stimulation (TENS) 
In TENS, a low-frequency 
electrical current is passed 
through the entire body to 
stimulate the nerves that sense 
touch (sensory nerves). TENS 
temporarily interrupts the 
transmission of pain signals  
to the brain. It’s widely used to 
treat chronic (long-term) pain.114 
However, the long-term effects 
of TENS in people with MS are 
not yet clear. 115, 116
TENS devices are available for 
home use, and health insurance 
companies sometimes help with 
costs. You must not use these 
devices during a relapse, when 
pregnant or if you have an 
electrical implant (for example, a 
pacemaker or defibrillator). Before 
starting TENS therapy, seek 
advice from a medical specialist.
Ultrasound therapy
Ultrasound therapy uses high-
frequency sound waves and is 
usually given at a physiotherapy 
practice. Therapists can use a device to give the therapy 
through the skin, or it can be 
given using a water bath (similar 
to a hydroelectric bath).
Ultrasound waves are reflected 
differently by different parts of 
the human body. This depends 
on the density of tissues. For 
instance, bones reflect sound 
waves more strongly than the 
surrounding tendons and 
muscles. This creates heat, 
which is thought to help chronic 
muscle pain.117
However, the effectiveness of 
ultrasound therapy in MS has not 
been scientifically proven.118, 119 You 
must not have ultrasound therapy 
during an active relapse, if you 
have a high level of inflammation, 
or if you have other conditions  
or diseases.

Section C: Therapies 
that should be avoided 
by people with MS due 
to concerns about safety 
or potential harm 6
The therapies described in this section are 
ones that should be avoided by people with 
MS. This is because there are concerns about 
their safety or they may cause harm.
Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosis 6  Section C: Therapies that should be avoided by people with MS 42 43Amalgam removal
Tooth fillings with amalgam  
may release small amounts of 
mercury.120 Mercury is a heavy 
metal that collects in cells and 
damages the immune and 
nervous systems. A few people 
with MS have reported that  
their symptoms reduced after 
amalgam removal. However,  
in large analyses of scientific 
studies, no connection between 
MS remission and amalgam 
removal was found.121, 122, 123 
Amalgam removal is costly  
and risky as mercury is inhaled 
during drilling and can also be 
swallowed. Thus, the mercury 
exposure during the removal of 
amalgam is higher than when  
the fillings remain in the tooth.124 
Bee venom therapy 
(apitherapy) 
In bee venom therapy 
(apitherapy), up to 40 bee stings 
are administered per session. This 
is intended to stimulate and 
strengthen the immune system. 
The venom is injected either with 
a needle or using live bees.125 A 
study of people with MS found that bee venom was not effective. 
However, if it causes an allergic 
reaction, this can be life-
threatening. Infections can also 
occur around the injection and 
sting sites.126, 127
Anti-Candida therapy
Candida albicans is a yeast found 
in skin, the intestines and vagina. 
Normally, it does not cause any 
problems, but fungal infections 
(candidiasis) can occur when 
there is an overgrowth of the 
yeast. Candidiasis can be treated 
with fungicides (antimycotics).
Some people speculate that yeast 
can damage the immune system 
and that people with MS should 
therefore have ‘anti-Candida 
therapy’. This consists of avoiding 
yeast products and taking certain 
vitamins and antifungals. The 
effectiveness of anti-Candida 
therapy is not proven. 
Antifungal drugs can have serious 
interactions with MS medicines 
and, depending on the dosage, 
can lead to organ damage.128  
You should only take antifungals 
as prescribed by a doctor.

44
Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosis 45Experimental drugs  
and poisons 
We strongly discourage the  
use of experimental drugs and 
poisons. Sale of these substances 
on the black market is illegal  
and where they come from is 
dubious. This also applies to 
Cobra toxin (derived from snake 
venom), about which repeated 
unfounded claims have been 
made in MS.134 The side effects 
can be life-threatening.99
Fresh cell therapy
In fresh cell therapy, cells  
from unborn or young lambs  
and calves are injected into the 
buttocks. There is no evidence 
to suggest that this is helpful. 
However, there is a risk of 
activating viruses that can 
cause disease, of severe allergic 
reactions and of transmitting 
diseases. Fresh cell therapy  
has been prohibited by law  
in some countries.135Herbal medicine
Herbal medicine (phytotherapy) 
is probably the oldest healing 
practice. Various plants  
and herbs that are thought to  
have medicinal effects are used 
worldwide for various diseases 
and ailments.136
It’s important that you tell your 
healthcare team before taking 
any medicinal plants and herbs. 
Even if some herbal medicines 
might stimulate healing, they can 
have risks. Some seemingly 
harmless herbs can cause 
significant side effects or interact 
with other drugs, while others are 
directly harmful.137, 138, 139, 140, 141Chelation therapy
Chelating agents such as  
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic 
acid (DMSA) and 
2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-
sulfonic acid are substances 
that can bind heavy metals in 
the body. They’re used as a 
medicine to treat people with 
heavy-metal poisoning. 
In alternative medicine, 
chelation therapy has been used 
in people with MS under the 
claim that it binds free radicals 
and cleans the arteries. This has 
been scientifically disproven.  
No therapeutic benefit has  
been demonstrated in MS.82
Chelating agents cause serious 
side effects such as an irregular 
heartbeat and organ damage. 
[129] Therefore, chelation 
therapy should not be used in 
people with MS unless they 
have an urgent medical need.
Electrical Muscle 
Stimulation (EMS)
EMS stands for electrical 
muscle stimulation or electromyostimulation. During 
EMS, your muscle fibres are 
stimulated directly by applied 
electrical impulses.130,131 In 
contrast to physical exercise, 
EMS doesn’t involve the nerves 
being stimulated, muscle 
control, or signals via the spinal 
cord. It is possible that the 
electrical impulses used in EMS 
could cause complications, 
especially for people having  
an MS relapse. 
Enzyme therapy 
Enzyme therapy claims to  
target immune complexes in  
the body. Immune complexes 
are combinations of an antigen 
and an antibody. In a clinical 
study of almost 300 people  
with MS, no benefits were found 
for an enzyme therapy called 
Phlogenzym®.132 Although 
enzyme therapies usually  
have few side effects, allergic 
reactions can occur. If enzyme 
therapy is given intravenously 
(by a drip), very serious side 
effects can occur.133

Wellness practices and complementary therapies in multiple sclerosis 47Hyperbaric oxygenation
In hyperbaric oxygenation you 
inhale compressed pure oxygen 
(100% medically pure oxygen). 
This is said to increase the 
oxygen content of the blood and 
thus have a positive effect on 
bodily functions. Originally, the 
method was used to treat divers 
and people with carbon 
monoxide poisoning. 
There is no evidence of  
benefit of the use of hyperbaric 
oxygenation in people with MS.142 
Serious side effects can include 
damage to the airways due the 
pressure of compressed oxygen, 
eardrum injuries and seizures.
Immune augmentation
In immune augmentation, an 
overreaction of the immune 
system is provoked, for example 
by an infusion (drip) of echinacea 
or vitamin C. However, because 
the immune system plays a role 
in MS,143, 99 immune augmentation 
is potentially dangerous for 
people with MS.Intestinal cleansing
Intestinal cleansing (also known 
as intestinal rehabilitation 
therapy) is proposed to ‘detoxify’ 
the body and thus strengthen 
the immune system. Fasting, 
laxatives or enemas might be 
used for this purpose.
There is no scientific proof that 
intestinal cleansing has benefits 
for people with MS. In fact, it 
could prevent the absorption  
of MS medicines. Fasting or 
depletion of nutrients weakens 
the body and immune system.  
In addition, some approaches to 
intestinal cleansing can lead to 
infections of the gastrointestinal 
tract, complications from 
existing intestinal diseases,  
and haemorrhoids. Therefore, 
we don’t recommend gut 
cleansing for people with MS. We encourage you to keep up to 
date with these through the  
MS organisation in your country. 
You can only make good 
decisions about managing your 
MS with your healthcare team  
 if you understand the various 
forms of therapy available. 
Exercise is proven to be 
effective in helping with some 
MS symptoms. Whilst the link 
between diet and MS is not yet 
fully understood, we do know 
that a healthy, varied diet has a 
positive effect on overall health.
To help manage your MS 
symptoms, you could also 
consider physiotherapy, occupational therapy and 
relaxation methods. Some other 
therapies described in this guide 
have been shown to have a 
positive impact on common 
symptoms of MS, including pain. 
Research continues in this area. 
If in doubt, always ask your 
healthcare team whether a 
particular complementary 
therapy is suitable for you to  
use alongside your medical 
treatment. In this way, you  
can develop a comprehensive 
therapy plan that is tailored to 
your personal needs. Conclusions7
MS cannot be cured, but it can be treated. 
New therapeutic approaches are 
constantly being developed, including 
DMTs, symptom treatments and 
complementary therapies.
